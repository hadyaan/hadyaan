<h1 align="center">Hi, I'm Faris ðŸ‘‹</h1>


I'm a final-year Informatics student at Gunadarma University whoâ€™s passionate about mobile development â€” especially with **Flutter** and **Dart**. 

Originally interested in data, I found my true calling in building beautiful, functional mobile applications. Since then, Iâ€™ve been diving deep into mobile app fundamentals, cross-platform development, and UI/UX principles. Iâ€™ve built a few simple but meaningful apps, like a money tracker and a habit tracker, as part of my learning journey.

## ðŸŒ± Currently Learning
- Flutter & Dart (Intermediate level)
- Firebase integration
- JavaScript basics
- UI design principles & front-end design (with Figma & Framer)
